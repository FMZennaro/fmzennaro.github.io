In this presentation we first offer a review of definitions of abstractions proposed in the literature, and then we propose a framework to align these definitions and evaluate their properties. We suggest analyzing abstractions on two layers (a structural layer and a distributional layer) and we review some basic properties that may be enforced on maps defined on each layer. We suggest that this framework may contribute to a better understanding of different forms of abstraction, as well as providing a way to tailor application-specific definitions of abstraction.
