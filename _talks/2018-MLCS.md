This talk provides an overview of some topics at the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning with the aim of illustrating the possibilities offered by machine learning and surveying recent promising lines of research at the border between the two disciplines. The first part of the talk gives a brief introduction to machine learning from a conceptual point of view. The second part then explores research topics in three main domains: applications of machine learning to security; security aspects of machine learning; and, finally, safety concerns related to machine learning.
