These slides analyze the application of reinforcement learning for modelling the problem of penetration testing in computer security. After a conceptual overview of reinforcement learning, we discuss which are the specific challenges in modeling penetration testing as a game that may be solved by a reinforcement learning agent. Finally, we present some of the work done by the research group at the University of Oslo on this topic, including conceptual modelling and preliminary practical implementations of reinforcement learning environments and agents.
