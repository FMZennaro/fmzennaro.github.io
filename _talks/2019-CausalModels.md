n this presentation we are going to introduce causal model from the point of view of computer science, following the approach based on structural causal models proposed by Pearl. We will start by showing the place of causality theory and by discussing its relationship with standard statistics. We will then present graphical models (directed acyclic grpahs, Bayesian networks, causal Bayesian networks, and structural causal models) to address causal questions. We will then review some paradigmatic problems that arise in the field of causality, and how they can be solved.
