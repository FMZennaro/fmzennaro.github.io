Sparse filtering is an algorithm for unsupervised learning proposed in 2011. The authors introduced this algorithm as a paradigm of feature distribution learning, contrasting it with more traditional data distribution learning. 
In this seminar, we will explore the ideas behind sparse filtering following the original paper published in 2011. We will first discuss the general idea of feature distribution learning; then, we will present the specific algorithm for sparse filtering; finally, we will conclude with a discussion of the algorithm and a summary of further developments since the publication of the original paper.
