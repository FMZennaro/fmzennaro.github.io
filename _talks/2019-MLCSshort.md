This talk provides a short presentations of three perspectives to explore the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning. It examines an instrumental perspective (in which ML is seen as a tool), a systemic perspective (in which ML is seen as component of a system to defend), and a societal perspective (in which ML is seen as a part of societal processes). Each perspective is reconnected with specific areas of research (cybersecurity, adversarial learning, AI safety).
