Causal models can represent an identical system or phenomenon at different levels of abstraction. In this talk, we will focus on structural causal models (SCM) and review two frameworks which have been proposed to express a relation of abstraction between SCMs and to measure the interventional consistency of an abstraction. We will then discuss some current directions of research, including the problem of learning abstractions.
