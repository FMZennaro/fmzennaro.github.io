Modelling complex systems and processes, such as battery manufacturing, is a significant scientific and technical challenge. Mathematics, statistics and machine learning provide useful tools to tackle this problem. In this talk, we will focus on the recent formalism of structural causal models (SCM) and casual abstractions (CA). We will first offer a high-level introduction to SCMs and CA, discussing in particular their importance and relevance for modelling. We will then make a reference to our original methodology for learning CAs. Finally, we will showcase our preliminary results on the problem of modelling one stage of the lithium-ion battery manufacturing process, demonstrating the potential for integrating data collected by different research groups.
