This talk will touch on two aspects of human reasoning that are crucial for AI: causal reasoning and multi-level reasoning. We will discuss the role and the relevance of causal models in machine learning systems, as well as the ubiquity of multi-level reasoning across applications. We will then review some recent approaches based on causal abstraction, aimed at integrating causal reasoning and multi-level reasoning. We will conclude by suggesting possible developments and deployment of these methods.
