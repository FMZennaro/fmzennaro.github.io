These slides provide a synthetic overview of the problem of relating structural causal models (SCMs) at different levels of abstraction. We define the problem and discuss the desiderata of our solution. We present a few of the existing formalizations and solutions offered in the literature. We then conclude highglighting interesting future direction of research in this area.
