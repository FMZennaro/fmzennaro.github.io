These slides provides a quick conceptual introduction to neural networks for supervised learning, and review some hypothesis and theories meant to explain the generalization performance of learning. The presentation then focuses on one of these possible interpretative frameworks, information bottleneck, and discusses its possible application to understand the dynamics of unsupervised learning algorithms, such as sparse filtering.
