This talk provides an overview of the research in the fields of adversarial machine learning and AI safety. The first part of the talk gives a brief introduction to machine learning from a conceptual point of view; the second and the third part respectively illustrates some representative attacks and defenses for machine learning systems; and, finally, the last part lists safety concerns related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. (This presentation has some overlap with the previous talk "Research Challenges for Applying Machine Learning in Cybersecurity")
