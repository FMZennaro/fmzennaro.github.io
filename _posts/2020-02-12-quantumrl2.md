In this post we keep exploring the integration of [IBM qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), a library developed to design, run and simulate quantum circuits, and [OpenAI gym](http://gym.openai.com/docs/), a library developed to define, train and run reinforcement learning agents.

We still rely on the quantum game, [qcircuit](https://github.com/FMZennaro/gym-qcircuit), that we presented in a previous [blogpost](https://fmzennaro.github.io/posts/2020-02-07-quantumrl1). This time we consider a more complex version of the game, where the player has to interact with a bigger quantum circuit, and has to reach a more challenging ending state.

As before, we deploy some pre-made agents made available in the [stable-baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) library, and train them on our quantum game. We then observe and compare the performance of these agents against the performance of a random agent.
