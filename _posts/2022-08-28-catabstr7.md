In previous posts we have discussed theoretical and conceptual properties of [abstractions](https://erischel.com/documents/mscthesis.pdf) between [causal models](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/), while at the same time implementing code for checking our statements and for running simulations.

In this notebook we take a break in our analysis of abstraction to focus on programming. Since all our code has been accumulated into a single monolithic Abstraction class, we refactor this code into multiple modular classes. This new code implementation will constitute the foundation for future analyses and simulations.
