In previous posts we have seen how to define [abstractions](https://erischel.com/documents/mscthesis.pdf) between [causal models](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/), and how to compute automatically the [abstraction error](https://erischel.com/documents/mscthesis.pdf) when switching from a micromodel to a macromodel.

In this notebook we consider an important theoretic property of abstraction, that is, composition of abstractions. Specifically, we re-implement the examples provided in a paper on the [compositionally of abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15758), and we empirically show that a proper choice of the metric to estimate the abstraction error guarantees a bound on the abstraction error of a composed abstraction.
