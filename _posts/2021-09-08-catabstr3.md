In previous posts we have analyzed how [causal models](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/) may be related to each other at different [levels of abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00819) relying on the framework proposed by [Rischel](https://erischel.com/documents/mscthesis.pdf) and grounded in [category theory](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/category-theory-sciences).

In this notebook we consider a different way to relate causal models via the notion of transformation, as it was proposed earlier by [Rubenstein et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00819). We consider this alternative definition and we setup a preliminary comparison between abstractions and transformations. We provide a number of examples in order to highlight similarities and differences in the two concepts and in their implications.
