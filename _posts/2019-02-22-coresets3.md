In a previous posts we have explored the use of [Bayesian coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05053) on [synthetic data](/posts/2019-01-24-coresets1) and its application to a [phishing data set](/posts/2019-02-06-coresets2). We replicated experiments from the [original article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05053) by integrating the [original code](https://github.com/trevorcampbell/bayesian-coresets) with the [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/) framework.

In this notebook, we continue our study of the [original article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05053) by evaluating the computation of Bayesian coresets in parallel. We use again a synthetic data set to explore the results produced by Bayesian coresets when running on identically-distributed sub-sets and differently-distributed sub-sets.
