In previous posts we have explored how [causal models](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/) may be related to each other at different [levels of abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00819) using the framework proposed by [Rischel](https://erischel.com/documents/mscthesis.pdf) to assess their consistency and evaluate the error that may be introduced by abstraction.

In this notebook we offer a basic implementation of an exhaustive algorithm that automatically compute the abstraction between two causal models, given an abstraction between them. We show the result of the algorithm using different algorithms to enumerate all the pairs of variables over which to evaluate the abstraction error. The code is then integrated in the *Abstraction* class in order to provide an easily callable method to compute abstraction error.
