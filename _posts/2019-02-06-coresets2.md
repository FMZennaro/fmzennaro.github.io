In a [previous post](/posts/2019-01-24-coresets1) we have explored the use of [Bayesian coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05053) on synthetic data and we have integrated the [original code](https://github.com/trevorcampbell/bayesian-coresets) with [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/) in order to exploit the features offered by probabilistic programming.

In this notebook, we now run a second tutorial in which we apply Bayesian coreset to a real dataset. Following again the [original article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05053), we retrieve the referenced [phising data set](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#phishing) and we analyze the performance of standard ML algorithms and Bayesian algorithms using Bayesian coresets.
