This class offers an introduction to machine learning using python. After a brief review of the main concepts in machine learning, the class discusses the main python environment to run and train machine learning models. Examples of basic applications of machine learning models (linear regression, logistic regression, k-means, classification trees, neural networks) are then illustrated using sckikit-learn. Finally, references for further learning are provided.

The class provides questions and exercises along the way to test your understanding. For the best experience, consider reading the slides using Jupyter with [RISE extension](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
